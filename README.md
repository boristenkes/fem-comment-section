## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus** ❌: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus** ✅: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### What I've added

- Users can create new accounts and log in to their existing accounts using a valid email address (the email address format must be valid but doesn't need to exist). Once logged in, their session will remain active for 2 days, meaning they won't need to log back in during that period.
- Within the user's menu, there are convenient functionalities such as logout, delete account, and edit account.
- It's important to note that all data is securely stored on [mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io)
